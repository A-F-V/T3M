# Project  and Planning

---
## Possible Datasets and Project :

Alessandro:
- *Age Detection*
- *Colour Scheme Generator* (Gives score to existing colour schemes, generates purely random colour scheme from scratch or from a starting colour). Also gives names to colour scheme.
- _(similiar, and possibly in addition, to above)_ *Mood-board generator*
- *Genetic algorithm that learns how to play 2048*
- *Cryptocurrency predictor* - predicts the success and failures of crypto currencies (could be extended to a stock market predictor)
- *Illegal fishing detector* - https://globalfishingwatch.org/map-and-data/
- *Text summarizer*
- *Body posture evaluator*
- *Black and White image colourer*
- *Film and TV Spoiler Blocker*
- *Bully/Troll detection on social media*
- *Diet from local food learning*

## Road Map
---

* 19/06/2020 - *GATHERING DATA* Download data and set up notebook. Initial explanation of the data, the problem and what in earth is going on.
* 21/06/2020 - *GATHER INSIGHTS* A few analyses of data with graphs, suggestions on composite features, and how the data should be pre-processed.
* 23/06/2020 - *GATHER MORE INSIGHTS AND PREPARE DATA FOR ML*
* 25/06/2020 - *SELECT MODELS AND TRAIN*
* 27/06/2020 - *FINE TUNE*
* 29/06/2020 - *TRANSFER INSIGHTS INTO PYTHON PROGRAM*
